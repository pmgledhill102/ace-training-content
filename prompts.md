## Initial Prompt

```text
Hello. Good morning.

I work at a large bank in their Cloud Platform team as an Engineering Lead for Cloud. I have all 12 Google Cloud certifications. I have been asked to run a set of training to prepare internal colleagues (50 in the first cohort) to take the Google Associate Certified Engineer Certification (I've attached the Exam Guide for this certification). The colleagues will have access to the Cloud Skills Boost platform, and will be advised to follow the "Cloud Engineer Learning Path" (https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/11). The main training will take place over 6 weeks, where for 1 hour each week we are proposing that I will run through a subset of the content, and I will walk through some exam like Questions and Answers, and talk people through the correct answer and why the wrong answers are not correct. After the 6 weeks, we'll then a final mop-up session which will also prepare people to take the exam.

I'd like help producing the content that we will cover each week. I'd also like help creating the Q&As for each that I can walk through.

I'm expecting the content to be a series of Powerpoint slides that I will talk over.

We are planning to align the topics each week to the modules of the Cloud Skills Boost Course...

Week 1:
Content: Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure
Labs: Implement Load Balancers on Compute Engine

Week 2:
Content: Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation & Core Services
Labs: Set Up an App Dev Env on Google Cloud

Week 3:
Content: Elastic Google Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation
Labs: Develop Your Own Google Cloud Network

Week 4:
Content: Logging and Monitoring in Google Cloud, Observability in Google Cloud

Week 5:
Content: Getting Started with Google Kubernetes Engine

Week 6:
Content: Getting Started with Terraform for Google Cloud
Labs: Build infrastructure with Terraform on Google Cloud

As this is quite a big task - can you suggest the list of things that I should be producing at a time. For each week's content, it feels like I would need content creating, some talking points for me, and then the Q&A content, along with a view of how this aligns to the certification objective
